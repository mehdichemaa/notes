# Estimated Conversions
Estimated conversions are a statistical modeling technique used in digital advertising to provide a more accurate and timely view of campaign performance. By using historical data to account for conversion delays and other factors, **platforms can estimate the full number of conversions, even for actions that haven't been reported yet**. This gives advertisers a more realistic picture of their results and helps them make better bidding and budget decisions sooner.

## How it works
- Models conversion delays: Some conversions, like a purchase, may happen days after a user first clicks an ad. Platforms use historical data to estimate how many more conversions will likely occur for past ad clicks. 
- Accounts for other factors: Estimated conversions can also factor in other adjustments, such as returns or conversions that are difficult to track directly. 
- Uses conversion modeling: The process involves a system that analyzes observed ad interactions and conversions, then uses this information to predict and estimate unobserved conversions. 
- Provides real-time insights: By layering these estimates on top of standard reporting, advertisers can see an early, more reliable read on performance instead of waiting days for all conversions to be reported. 

## Why it's important
- Better decision-making: With a more complete picture of performance, advertisers can make more informed decisions about their bidding strategies and budgets. 
- Early insights: It allows for a quicker understanding of campaign results, enabling faster optimization. 
- More accurate reporting: It provides a more accurate representation of performance by including conversions that may not have been visible or reported yet.
